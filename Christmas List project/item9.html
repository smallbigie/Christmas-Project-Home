        <section class="description">
            <p>The red panda is a small, adorable mammal native to the mountain forests of the Himalayas and southwestern China. With a reddish-brown fur coat, black legs, and a bushy, ringed tail, it has a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other animals. Its face is rounded with large, dark eyes and white markings on the cheeks, giving it a perpetually curious and endearing look.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite its name, the red panda is not closely related to the giant panda; it's more closely related to raccoons and weasels. Itâ€™s an arboreal species, spending most of its time in trees, where it feeds on bamboo, fruits, acorns, and small insects. Known for its playful and shy nature, the red panda is an endangered species, with conservation efforts focusing on protecting its habitat.</p>
