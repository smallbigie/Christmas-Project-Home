            <p>The ring-tailed lemur is a charismatic and unique primate native to the island of Madagascar. It is easily recognizable by its long, bushy tail, adorned with striking black and white rings. Its fur is predominantly gray with white underparts, and it has a distinctive black mask-like face with bright, expressive amber or yellow eyes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ring-tailed lemurs are social animals, living in groups called troops. They are highly agile, often seen leaping gracefully between trees or foraging on the ground. Known for their sunbathing posture, they sit upright, arms outstretched, soaking up warmth. These lemurs are not only symbols of Madagascar but also ambassadors for the importance of wildlife conservation.</p>
